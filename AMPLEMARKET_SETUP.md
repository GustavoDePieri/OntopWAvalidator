# üîç Amplemarket API Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you configure and test the Amplemarket API integration for finding phone numbers for customers.

## Step 1: Get Your Amplemarket API Key

1. Log in to your Amplemarket account at [https://app.amplemarket.com](https://app.amplemarket.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings ‚Üí API** (or visit directly: [https://app.amplemarket.com/settings/api](https://app.amplemarket.com/settings/api))
3. Click **"Create New API Key"** or **"Generate API Key"**
4. Copy the API key (it will look something like: `amp_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
5. Store it securely - you won't be able to see it again!

## Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project if it doesn't exist:

```bash
# Amplemarket API Configuration
AMPLEMARKET_API_KEY=amp_live_your_actual_api_key_here
AMPLEMARKET_BASE_URL=https://api.amplemarket.com
```

**Important Notes:**
- Never commit `.env.local` to git (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- The base URL is usually `https://api.amplemarket.com` (already set as default)
- If you have a different API endpoint, update the `AMPLEMARKET_BASE_URL` accordingly

## Step 3: Verify API Key Format

Your API key should:
- Start with `amp_live_` for production or `amp_test_` for testing
- Be approximately 40-50 characters long
- Only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores

## Step 4: Test the Integration

### Option 1: Test via UI
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

3. Log in with your credentials

4. Find a customer in the table

5. Click the **Search Icon** (üîç) next to any customer

6. The system will:
   - Search for the customer using their name, email, and company
   - Display alternative phone numbers found
   - Show confidence scores for each suggestion

7. Check the **browser console** (F12 ‚Üí Console tab) for detailed logs

### Option 2: Test via API Endpoint
Use a tool like Postman, Insomnia, or curl:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/search/phone \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: auth-token=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "company": "Example Corp"
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Phone search completed",
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "contact-123",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "+1234567890",
      "company": "Example Corp",
      "position": "CEO",
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

## Step 5: Monitoring and Debugging

### Server-Side Logs
When you use the search feature, you'll see detailed logs in your terminal:

```
üîç Amplemarket: Starting search with params: { name: "...", email: "...", company: "..." }
‚úÖ Amplemarket API key present: amp_live_x...
üåê Base URL: https://api.amplemarket.com
üì§ Strategy 1: GET /people/find?email=...
üîó URL: https://api.amplemarket.com/people/find?email=...
‚úÖ GET /people/find SUCCESS - Status: 200
üì• Response data: { ... }
üîç Parsing Amplemarket response...
üìã Single person object detected
üìä Processing 1 contact(s)...
üîë Available fields: id, email, name, phone_number, mobile_number, ...
üìû Found 2 phone number(s): ["+1234567890", "+9876543210"]
‚úÖ Found 2 phone number(s) out of 1 contact(s)
üéâ Found 2 phone numbers!
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: "Amplemarket API key not configured"
**Problem:** The API key is missing or not loaded.

**Solutions:**
- Verify `.env.local` exists in the project root
- Ensure `AMPLEMARKET_API_KEY` is set in `.env.local`
- Restart the development server after adding the key
- Check for typos in the environment variable name

#### Issue 2: "401 Unauthorized" Error
**Problem:** API key is invalid or expired.

**Solutions:**
- Verify the API key is correct (check for extra spaces)
- Generate a new API key from Amplemarket settings
- Ensure you're using a production key (`amp_live_`) not a test key
- Check if your Amplemarket account is active

#### Issue 3: "429 Too Many Requests"
**Problem:** Rate limit exceeded.

**Solutions:**
- Amplemarket allows 350 requests per minute for `/people/find`
- Wait a minute before trying again
- Reduce the frequency of bulk searches
- Consider implementing caching for frequently searched contacts

#### Issue 4: "No phone numbers found"
**Problem:** The API returned a contact but no phone numbers.

**Solutions:**
- Check the console logs to see the actual response structure
- The contact might not have phone data in Amplemarket's database
- Try searching with different parameters (email is most accurate)
- Verify the contact exists in Amplemarket's database

#### Issue 5: "insufficient_credits" Error
**Problem:** Your Amplemarket account has no credits.

**Solutions:**
- Check your Amplemarket credit balance
- Purchase more credits or upgrade your plan
- The mock data fallback will be used automatically

## Step 6: Understanding the Search Strategies

The integration uses 3 fallback strategies to find phone numbers:

### Strategy 1: Find by Email (Most Accurate)
```
GET https://api.amplemarket.com/people/find?email={email}
```
- **When used:** If the customer has an email address
- **Accuracy:** Highest (email is a unique identifier)
- **Rate Limit:** 350 requests/minute

### Strategy 2: Find by Name + Company
```
GET https://api.amplemarket.com/people/find?name={name}&company_name={company}
```
- **When used:** If email search fails but name and company are available
- **Accuracy:** Good (if name and company are unique)
- **Rate Limit:** 350 requests/minute

### Strategy 3: Broad Search
```
POST https://api.amplemarket.com/people/search
Body: { person_name: "...", company_names: ["..."] }
```
- **When used:** As a last resort if other strategies fail
- **Accuracy:** Lower (returns multiple potential matches)
- **Returns:** Up to 10 results

## Step 7: Phone Number Fields

The API checks for phone numbers in these fields (in priority order):

1. `mobile_number` - Cell phone (preferred)
2. `phone_number` - General contact number
3. `work_number` - Office phone
4. `sourced_number` - From external sources
5. `manually_added_number` - Manually added
6. Other fallback fields: `phone`, `mobile_phone`, `direct_phone`, etc.

## Step 8: Production Deployment

When deploying to production (e.g., Vercel):

1. Go to your project settings in the deployment platform
2. Add the environment variables:
   ```
   AMPLEMARKET_API_KEY=amp_live_your_actual_api_key
   AMPLEMARKET_BASE_URL=https://api.amplemarket.com
   ```
3. Redeploy the application
4. Test the integration in production

## API Reference

### Search for Phone Numbers
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/search/phone`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "company": "Example Corp",
  "currentPhone": "+1234567890" (optional - to exclude from results)
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Phone search completed",
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "contact-123",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "phone": "+1555123456",
      "company": "Example Corp",
      "position": "CEO",
      "confidence": 0.85
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Email When Possible:** Email searches are the most accurate
2. **Cache Results:** Store search results to avoid redundant API calls
3. **Handle Rate Limits:** Implement delays between bulk searches
4. **Monitor Credits:** Keep track of your Amplemarket credit usage
5. **Validate Results:** Always validate phone numbers with Twilio after finding them
6. **Fallback to Mock Data:** The system automatically falls back to mock data during development

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check Server Logs:** Look for detailed error messages in the terminal
2. **Check Browser Console:** Client-side errors will appear here
3. **Verify API Key:** Ensure it's correct and active
4. **Test Manually:** Try the Amplemarket API directly with curl
5. **Contact Amplemarket Support:** For API-specific issues

## Testing Checklist
